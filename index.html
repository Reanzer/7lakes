					<p>The seven lakes of San Pablo City are truly marvelous. 

They are hidden gems waiting to be explored. Unfortunately they are not yet ready for accepting an influx of tourists, nor are they in a current sustainable ecological position.

We don't want another ecological devastation to happen. 
That is creating a tourist spot out of a pristine place, only to destroy it in the process.</p>

					<h2 >The most famous of them is Lake <a name="sampaloc">Sampaloc</a>, and the legend goes like this:</h2>
					<p>
					<br/><br/>
There was once a rich man who owned an orchard of tamarind trees. One day, a beggar passed by the old man &#8216;s house. Since the tree was in its full bloom, there were lots of tamarinds on the ground. He asked the old man for a piece of the tamarind to aid his starving stomach.  The rich man, in his greed and pride, refused the beggar. He drove the man away using his dogs. In tears and wrath, the beggar fled. As night time came, a storm started brewing. Thunder and lightning ensued.  The earth opened and sunk the estate of the rich man including his orchard of tamarind trees. The hole was flooded by the raging storm. The storm only stopped at dawn. Only a great pool of water was left on the rich man &#8216;s great estate.

							<h3><a name="kalibato">Calibato</a></h3>
							<p>Nature is very peaceful, but you don &#8216;t want to look at its bad side.  A once virgin and isolated valley was desecrated by men when they came and reaped the trees and fruits. Men also slaughtered the wild animals, not just for food but for game. Looking at the devastation of his once beautiful and untouched valley, the guardian was angered. He cursed the men, and the earth opened. Water came from its depths and devoured everything. The once peaceful valley was transformed into lagoon.

							<h3><a name="twin">The Twin Lakes</a></h3>
							<p>The story of the twin lakes is filled with silliness and misdemeanors, but at the same time will get you thinking how silly one&#8216;s action can be because of love.<br/><br/>
There was once a couple who could not bear any child. They prayed and prayed, and finally their wish was granted. A diwata showed up in their dream and told them that they would have a child, but the child can never walk nor step on the earth, lest a tragedy will occur. <br/><br/>
The child grew up into a beautiful woman. Countless suitors wooed her but no one was successful. The day came when her true prince would arrive. He courted her day, and night. The girl finally fell in love. But alas, they cannot be together because of her predicament. This made her prince really angry. After everything he has done, the girl still won &#8216;t go with her on a proper date that is outside her home. He threw away her favorite ball of thread. He did not understand what he did, nor did he understand the repercussions. His action greatly upset the woman. <br/><br/>
The woman begged her prince to retrieve it for her. She screamed at his woman, and nagged everything about his sacrifices for her and how her love compares to his love. In her feat of anger, the woman forgot about her parents warning and stepped afoot on the ground. One step is all it took and everything started filling with water. The prince tried to save his woman but alas, torrents of water gushed from all sides. There was nowhere to run. He tried holding onto the woman but she was being dragged by an undercurrent from the other side. They were separated from each other and the prince died holding a ball of thread of the love of his life. . .<br/><br/>
The man was named Yambo, and the woman was named Pandin.

							<h3><a name="bunot">Bunot</a></h3>
							<p>A group of Spanish surveyors arrived at a quiet lagoon. Under a coconut tree was man working with husks. The surveyors asked the man what the lagoon was called, but since the man did not understand their language, he assumed that they were asking about the product he was creating. As such, he uttered &#8220;Bunot &#8221;.</p>

							<h3><a name="mojicap">Muhikap</a></h3>
							<p>Munika was a very industrious sculptor. Unfortunately, she was also a sickly girl. She was born from an opulent family. As such, she lived on a mansion. One time, all of her helpers wanted to get a time off and begged Munika to let them off for the night. Being the kind girl that she is, she gave them a two-week vacation to another island. <br/><br/>
Tragedy struck! Alone in the night, bad people entered her estate. They ravaged the mansion and destroyed her work. She cried and begged her assailants to take everything but spare her. They did not listen. They got drunk and raped her and left her to dead. Dying, lying on the floor, she prayed that justice be done to these wrong doers. The ground trembled. A storm stand started and a big earthquake came. The robbers turned rapists were too drunk to run so the earth swallowed them whole. Everything was washed away by the rain. <br/><br/>
A week after, her servants came back. They wept once they saw what was left of the estate because they came back too late. The only thing that remained was a piece their master&#8216;s favorite stone floating on the water. They called the lake Muhikap because of Munika and her trait of being <i>Masikap</i>.

							<h3><a name="palakpakin">Palakpakin</a></h3>
							<p>There was a village with a huge tree named Palakpak. Every moonlit night, a beautiful woman can be seen washing her red hair. In the lake beside the village, was a big red fish that also appeared when the woman appeared. The villagers, fearing that it was a Diwata, did not approach the woman nor tried catching the fish. <br/><br/>
One moonlit night, a hungry foreigner arrived. Since it was already late, he didn &#8216;t asked for food from the villagers, and just tried to fish for himself. To his luck, he reeled in the red fish, As he was about to take it away to fire up and cook, the woman appeared and demanded him to put the fish back in the water. Dazzled by the woman &#8216; beauty, he followed her orders. Thankfully, the woman was kind, and gave him a bucket full of fish in return. They grew up to be good friends. <br/><br/>
The day came when the foreigner had to leave the village to go back his home. In tears, they hugged one last time and turned their separate ways. The Diwata was broken hearted; she had already fallen in love. As such, she vowed never to show up again in the human world. Because of her kindness, before she left, she left a blessing for the remaining villagers and hungry backpackers in the form of shrimps. The lake was abounded with shrimps, but no more Diwata. The villagers named the lake and the hipons, Palakpakin in her memory. <br/><br/>
